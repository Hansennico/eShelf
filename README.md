# eShelf

**EShelf** is an application for **online bookstores**. There are several features that eShelf will have. Eshelf is an e-commerce app, which means that eShelf will have search and exploration features. Eshelf allows customers to easily search for their desired books or explore new books and genres via online. The questionnaires that we conducted show that many bookreaders find it hard to find books in bookstores. Therefore, we want to make an exploration feature that enables us to search books easily. Each book will have information that can be viewed by customers, such as title, author, publish date, publisher, hypnosis, price, and ratings. This will allow customers to know more about the book's details before buying it.

Customers can either rent or buy the desired books and manage their quantity. Books will have two types, which are physical books and eBooks. The result of the questionnaires shows that many readers prefer reading from physical books. We want to provide as many options as possible for the customer to choose based on their preferences. Physical books can only be bought and delivered to the customer's address. On the other hand, eBooks can be rented or bought. The customer's account will have access to eBooks. However, if the eBooks are rented, the eBooks will be returned automatically when it's due. After the customer either rents or buys the books, then they will have to pay it according to its price.

From the business side, eShelf will have an inventory management system, where it will check the quantity of stocks. If the stocks are low, then it will tell the company to restock. The books will be provided by producers so eShelf will communicate with them to restock books. Other than inventory management, eShelf supports delivery management, where it will validate the books, customer details, and the shipping provider to deliver the books correctly.
